The original IConsoleHandoff.h and ITerminalHandoff.h were generated by IDL. Since this project uses pure C++, there's no need for such a complex method; the interface definitions can be written directly.

midl.exe /W1 /nologo /char signed /env x64 /out ".\" /h "IConsoleHandoff.h" /target "NT100" IConsoleHandoff.idl
midl.exe /W1 /nologo /char signed /env x64 /out ".\" /h "ITerminalHandoff.h" /target "NT100" ITerminalHandoff.idl

TilFeatureStaging.h is generated by Generate-FeatureFlags.proj through calling Generate-FeatureStagingHeader.ps1.
